# Hello-World-B
2nd attempt at create repository and then add branch
A bit about myself.  I am a retired IT guy. Still having fun with software but I sometimes take on an acting project. Otherwise I keep busy with web site creation/maintenance.  I have a big job comming and I need to add serious RWD to my skillset in order to survive/succeed
